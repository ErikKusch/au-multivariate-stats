# Multivariate analysis of biological data using R

### Aarhus University PhD Course

### September 19<sup>th</sup> &ndash; 23<sup>rd</sup> 

## Objectives of the course

The aim of the course is to provide an introduction to the analysis of multivariate data arising from observation and experimental studies with the R statistical software.

## Learning outcomes and competences

After completing the course, participants will

1. have a good introductory understanding of the main approaches used in the analysis of multivariate data sets
2. be able to choose an appropriate method to use to analyse a data set
3. understand how to use restricted permutation tests with constrained ordination methods to test the effects of predictor variables or experimental treatments
4. be able to use the R statistical software to analyse multivariate data

## Compulsory programme

Active participation in the course including attendance at lectures and completion of computer-based classes and exercises. A learn by teaching approach will be used for the computer-based assessments, where each participant will be expected to, as part of a small group, demonstrate their approach to the analysis of a problem data set from the previous day. Completion of short, computer-based assessments testing their understanding of a topic and the practical skills taught.

## Course content

The course is based on a series of lectures and computer based practical classes led by an international expert in the analysis of multivariate data, who is also one of the senior developers of the vegan R package and the creator of the permute R package.

The course covers the following topics:

* An introduction to multivariate data and their analysis
* Dissimilarity and dissimilarity coefficients
* Cluster Analysis
* Unconstrained ordination
    - Principal Components Analysis
    - Correspondence Analysis
    - Principal Coordinates Analysis
    - Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling
* Constrained ordination
    - Redundancy Analysis
    - Canonical Correspondence Analysis
    - Distance-based Redundancy Analysis
    - PERMANOVA and PERMDISP
* Statistical testing using permutation tests
* The future of multivariate data analysis
* Introduction to recently-developed latent variable approaches to ordination

## Prerequisites

This course is suitable for Phd students (including senior thesis-based masters students) and researchers working with multivariate data sets in biology (inter alia animal science, ecology, agriculture, microbial ecology/microbiology). Some basic prior knowledge of R is required.
